# week06FE-assignments

Version 1 was created using only one class. 
After discussing with Kristina and Chris, I chose to break the project up into 3 classes as it is in the second version.
In the third version, I made the Players class a Player class and then created 2 instances of Player them in the Game class. Please use the final version to run and evaluate. It is the only one that includes unit testing as well.
